# Code repository for the Oberlin College Computer Science 2024 Winter Term p2p Software Application Project

## Running
- Source `set-up-python-venv.sh`
- Run `make`

For example:
```sh
. set-up-python-venv.sh
make
```

This will initialize a python environment and activate it locally to this project. To tear down the
environment execute the `deactivate` command at your shell prompt.

### Application Description and Feature Set

### Use cases

### Personas

### User Stories

## Enhancement List
May want to try https://pypi.org/project/nose/ for running tests for its enhanced feature set. The
simple `Makefile` using `unittest`'s discover functionality suffices to start.
